        I'm a skilled software developer with extensive experience in C# and .NET, proficient in frameworks like MVC and Razor. 
        Additionally, I have some experience in Django but am currently expanding my knowledge in data science and machine learning, 
        areas I'm deeply passionate about. While I excel as a full-time backend developer in C# and .NET,
        I'm also comfortable working with Django for backend development. While my React.js skills are still developing, 
        I'm eager to learn and contribute. However, my true passion lies in data science and machine learning,
        where I'm seeking opportunities to grow as an intern.I'm committed to collaborating closely with clients to deliver efficient, scalable,
        and user-friendly solutions that address real-world challenges. 
        Let's join forces to turn your vision into reality—your ideas, my expertise—so that together, we can grow and innovate.
